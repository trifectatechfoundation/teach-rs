/// One way to implement a queue is to use a linked list; however, that requires a lot of dynamic memory manipulation to add/remove individual items.
/// A more low-level approach is to use a circular buffer: the compromise is that the capacity of the queue is then "fixed". For a background on circular buffers,
/// you can consult https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer

// A partial implementation is provided below; please finish it and add some more methods; please remember to run 'cargo fmt' and 'cargo clippy' after
// every step to get feedback from the rust compiler!

// 1) implement read()

// 2) the queue now has a fixed size; change the definition so that the data member becomes a Box<[u8]>; you can use the provided function 'make_box' to make
// boxed slices of arbitrary sizes. Make changes to your method definitions as needed (the definition of 'write' should not need changes!)

// 3) change the method 'new()' into 'new(size: usize)' that initializes a ring buffer of the given size (instead of a fixed size of 16); use the 'make_box' function.

// 4) in a queue that has size N, how many elements can be stored at one time? (test your answer experimentally)

// 5) EXTRA EXERCISES:
//  - add a method "has_room" so that "queue.has_room()" is true if and only if writing to the queue will succeed
//  - add a method "peek" so that "queue.peek()" returns the same thing as "queue.read()", but leaves the element in the queue
