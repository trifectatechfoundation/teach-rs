Today, we're focusing on concurrency: _asynchronous programming_

# What's async?

- Concurrent programming model
- Very suitable for running large number of I/O bound tasks
  - like web servers!
- Look and feel* of synchronous code through `async`/`await` syntax

**Well, not perfectly. We'll get to that*

# Async vs OS Threads

# What `async` looks like in Rust
To get an idea

```rust
/// An async function
async fn run() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    /// Await loading and parsing config file
    let config = load_config(CONFIG_PATH).await?;
    /// Await scraping job
    let data = scrape(&config.urls).await?;
    data.report();
    Ok(())
}

fn main() {
    // Set up a `tokio` runtime with default configurations
    let runtime = tokio::runtime::Runtime::new().unwrap();
    // Run a Future to completion
    runtime.block_on(run());
}
```

*Question: What stands out to you? What strikes you as odd?*

# Async in Rust

- Revolve around `Future` trait (~like JS `Promise`, C# `Task`)  
  &rarr; `async fn`s return `Future`s

- `Future`s are inert
- `async` is zero-cost
- No built-in runtime
- Single- or multithreaded execution
- Can be mixed with other concurrency models
- Relatively new and lacks some features and nice diagnostics

# State of the `async` art
What you can expect doing `async` Rust

- Blazingly fast applications
- More interaction with advanced language features
- Compatibility issues (re: colored functions)
- Faster evolving ecosystem
- `async fn` in Traits not stable

*But still a work in progress*

# Support of `async`

- Fundamental types and traits are in `std`
- `async`/`await` are native to the language
- Utilities/extensions in `futures` crate
- Async runtimes are third party

Example runtimes: `async-std`, `tokio`, `smol`
