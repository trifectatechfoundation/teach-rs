# Rust 101 

Rust 101 is a university course for computer science students, introducing the Rust Programming Language. The course assumes intermediate C/C++ knowledge.

Why? Have a look at our [slides](./intro-101-rs.pdf) introducing the course.

*Currently highly in flux, and incomplete, but feedback is welcome!*

This repo will contain everything that's needed to organize the course: slides, exercises, tools, setup instructions and more.

## High-level goals

1. Ability to write custom CLI/server applications using popular crates or to contribute to existing projects
2. Ability to teach Rust to other people
3. Get practical, hands-on experience
4. Deep dive, intermediate level Rust skill
5. Know the problems Rust aims to solve
6. Ability to judge whether Rust fits project requirements
7. Know why Rust features are the way they are

The course outline, along with more elaborate learning objectives, can be found [here](./COURSE.md).

## About the project

Rust 101 aims to provide an open-source course, lectures, tutorials and exercises, that can be used by any higher education institution. In its entirity or by using bits and pieces to create your custom course.


The project is executed by [Tweede golf](https://tweedegolf.nl).
