# Module E - Async and Rust for Web

[Slides](/slides/E/) (or [pdf](/slides/E-async-web.pdf))

## E.1 Channels
Channels are a very useful way to communicate between threads and `async` tasks. They allow for decoupling your application into many tasks. You'll see how that can come in nicely in exercise E.2. In this exercise, you'll implement two variants: a oneshot channel and a multi-producer-single-consumer (MPSC) channel. If you're up for a challenge, you can write a broadcast channel as well.

### E.1 A MPSC channel ⭐⭐
A multi-producer-single-consumer (MPSC) channel is a channel that allows for multiple `Sender`s to send many messages to a single `Receiver`.

Open `exercises/E/1-channels` in your editor. You'll find the scaffolding code there. For part A, you'll work in `src/mpsc.rs`. Fix the `todo!`s in that file in order to make the test pass. To test, run:

```bash
cargo test -- mpsc
```

If your tests are stuck, probably either your implementation does not use the `Waker` correctly, or it returns `Poll::Pending` where it shouldn't.

### E.1 A oneshot channel ⭐⭐⭐
A oneshot is a channel that allows for one `Sender` to send exactly one message to a single `Receiver`.

For part B, you'll work in `src/broadcast.rs`. This time, you'll have to do more yourself. Intended behavior:

- `Receiver` implements `Future`. It returns `Poll::Ready(Ok(T))` if `inner.data` is `Some(T)`, `Poll::Pending` if `inner.data` is `None`, and `Poll::Ready(Err(Error::SenderDropped))` if the `Sender` was dropped.
- `Receiver::poll` replaces `inner.waker` with the one from the `Context`.
- `Sender` consumes `self` on send, allowing the it to be used no more than once. Sending sets `inner.data` to `Some(T)`. It returns `Err(Error::ReceiverDropped(T))` if the `Receiver` was dropped before sending.
- `Sender::send` wakes `inner.waker` after putting the data in `inner.data`
- Once the `Sender` is dropped, it marks itself dropped with `inner`
- Once the `Receiver` is dropped, it marks itself dropped with `inner`
- Upon succesfully sending the message, the consumed `Sender` is not marked as dropped. Instead `std::mem::forget` is used to avoid running the destructor.

To test, run:
```bash
cargo test -- broadcast
```
