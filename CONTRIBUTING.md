# Contributing

Great that you want to contribute to teach-rs! Here's some ways in which you can help improve the project.

## Improving the material
If you see anything you think can easily be improved with a small pull request, such as fixing typos, fixing links or re-formulating sentences, please open a PR directly.

If you want to propose a structural change to one or more modules, please open an issue first, so we can discuss your ideas.
Please clearly state your proposed changes and your motivation for suggesting the changes. In case an improvement proposal is accepted, a PR with the changes referring to the relevant issue can be made.

## Adding a module
Teach-rs is intended to be used as a basis for custom courses that either are about Rust itself or use Rust to teach some other concept.
To that end, the teach-rs project aims to incorporate modules on diverse topics.

If you feel teach-rs should cover a topic that is currently not covered, you can propose adding a module by opening an issue.
State the main goal and the learning objectives of the module, as well as the covered topics and proposed exercises.
In case an addition proposal is accepted, a PR with the proposed changes referring to the relevant issue can be opened.

Have a look at the structure of the current slides and exercises to get a better understanding of how modules are organized.

## Trying it out on your students
Teach-rs is distributed under a [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license, so even if you don't have the time to contribute to this repository directly, you are free to teach from it
and to adapt its material to suit your students' needs. You can also help the development of teach-rs by communicating your experiences---what modules did your students like, which ones did they struggle with?

Just open an issue and don't forget to mention (without going into personal details) what the background of your students is and which parts of the course you used.
